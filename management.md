# For working with a manager

1. This article is about how to manage your relationship with your manager. While it is focussed on working with a micromanager, I really like it's suggestion under the "Start the Conversation" section:
"""I’m a big fan of the SBI (situation-behavior-impact) model, which looks something like this:

“In yesterday’s meeting with our Product Manager (situation), you answered a question about my work (behavior), which made me feel like you don’t trust me to speak for myself (impact)”."""
