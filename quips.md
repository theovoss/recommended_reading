Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Rick Osborne)

Good class architecture is not like a Swiss Army Knife; it should be more like a well balanced throwing knife. - Mike McShaffry

Be regular and orderly in your life ... so that you may be violent and original in your work." -- Gustave Flaubert

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. But it could be arranged.

Whoever oscillates between the thoughts of considering themselves genius and at the same time completely retarded would certainly love coding.

Help! My Reality Check bounced.

Stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone ought to be.

You never truly understand something until you can explain it to your grandmother.

Ideas are good; code is better

The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity. (Douglas Horton)

There may be more beautiful times; but this one is ours.

Complex, difficult problems have simple, easy to understand wrong answers

Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. (Edsger Dijkstra)

For more peace and quiet, how about a phone-less cord?

The chance that you'll forget something is directly proportional to.....to....ah.....

I'm sorry, that's not vague enough for me. Could you be a little less specific?

You cannot achieve the impossible without attempting the absurd.

Even a woodpecker owes his success to the fact that he uses his head.

When you are at the end of your rope…tie a knot and swing :)

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.

“What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” — George Eliot

# Programming specific
Bugs are just a way of proving you are not perfect

There is no such thing as bug free software

Software uncertainty principle: You can know what a program does, or what you want it to do, but not both.

C is like hippy parents: lets you do things you shouldn't

You can only get so much good data from a bad measurement

“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.” - Edsger Dijkstra

“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.” - Brian Kernighan

"Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code."

The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague. (Edsger Dijkstra)

If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with. (Edsger Dijkstra)

Test software until fear turns to boredom.
